# crowdfunding_ETL

### Team Members:
Kelsey Kraft and
Mariah McLelan

### Project Details:
For this project we built an ETL pipeline using Pandas to analyze crowdfunding data . Extracting data from excel we create four pandas dataframes. After we created our pandas dataframes, we worked on cleaning the data by renaming columns, changing data formats, and sorting the data. Once we had our clean dataframes we exported them as CSVs. With our CSVs we created an ERD for each of our tables in the CSVs. Using the ERD we created a table scheme to create a corresponding SQL database.

### Code Assistance:
There are a few places in the Jupyter Notebook file where some help from the internet was necessary. The URLs used have been commented out in the code before the lines they apply to.
